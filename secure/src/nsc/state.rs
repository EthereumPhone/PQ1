//! Gateway state singleton.
//!
//! This module is the **only** place in the secure world where mutable
//! gateway state lives as a `static mut`. Every command handler reaches
//! it through the [`with_state`] / [`peek_state`] closure accessors, so
//! there is exactly one address-taking site for the whole crate.
//!
//! ## Why a closure API and not a raw `&mut`
//!
//! The gateway is single-threaded and non-reentrant — `poll_gateway`
//! runs a single dispatch to completion before looking at another
//! command, and command handlers do not yield — so exclusive access
//! is guaranteed by construction. Wrapping the access in a closure
//! lets callers spell out that invariant at the call site without
//! sprinkling `unsafe { &mut STATE }` across every handler, and makes
//! the module trivially refactorable to a critical-section-guarded
//! `RefCell` later if we ever need to support preemption.
